my ribs are nothing but just an empty cage
black hole in my chest


big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away

**chorus**

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
